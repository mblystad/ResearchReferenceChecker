# Test Documents

Binary fixtures are generated on the fly during tests to keep the repository lightweight. The `sample_docx_path` fixture builds a one-page DOCX containing numbered citations [1], [2], an author citation (Doe, 2021), and a four-entry reference list with one uncited entry to exercise negative cases.
